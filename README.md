Featurette
=====

Featurette is a super simple javascript library for adding javascript features to
elements in a web page. It's based on patterns that we've used at
[Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) to make our javascript less
obtrusive and to have fewer in page scripts.

Getting Started
----

To add a feature to an element involves writing and registering a class that defines
your feature and then declaring that you want to use that feature on a
particular element. Let's look at a quick example feature. While this
example is written in CoffeeScript, you can use JavaScript with
Featurette as well.

A feature can be any JavaScript object. Let's define a feature that adds
cool Spanish exclamation marks to whatever element it's applied to.
We're using jQuery with this feature, just to make life a little easier.

Here's the feature:

```coffeescript
class Exclamation
  constructor: (element) ->
    $element = $(element)
    newText = "ยก#{$element.text()}!"
    $element.text(newText)

Featurette.register("exclamation", Exclamation)
```

We define a class called `Exclamation` with a constructor that takes one
argument, the element that we're attaching the feature to. Once that
class is defined we call `Featurette.register` to register the feature
that we defined. The first argument of `Featurette.register` is the
name we'll use to apply that feature, and the second argument is the
class that we'll instantiate to attach the feature.

Now, let's imagine we want to add the `exclamation` feature to an `h1`
tag in our page. Let's look at what's required to do that. You'll want
to make sure to call `Featurette.load` once the DOM loads. We don't
include that automatically in Featurette because there are quite a few
different libraries that handle DOM loaded events, and Featurette
doesn't prefer one of them over the other.

Most people do use jQuery, though, so here's how to handle loading
Featurette with jQuery:

```javascript
  $(function() { Featurette.load(); });
```

Now let's attach that `exclamation` feature to the `h1` tag:

```html
<h1 data-featurette="exclamation">Hola</h1>
```

The `data-featurette` attribute on the `h1` tells Featurette what
feature to instantiate. So, when the document loads Featurette will
search for all elements with Featurette on them and instantiate the class
that corresponds to the feature name given on that element with
`data-featurette`.

Accessing Featurette Objects
-----

When you attach a feature to an element it's given an id if it doesn't
already have one. You can use `Featurette.get("id")` to access the feature attached to
an element with the passed id.

Contributing
----

Featurette uses Babel to transpile ES6 to something that all browsers can
use. That means you'll need Babel installed to work with Featurette:

```sh
npm install -g babel
```

Once you have Babel installed youc an build the script with this command:

```sh
babel src/featurette.js --out-file lib/featurette.js
```
