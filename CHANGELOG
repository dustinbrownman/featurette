Changelog

3.0.0 (pending)

* Moved Featurette's language to ES6 from CoffeeScript.
* Featurette.register now only takes the class. `data-featurette` now expects
  the name of the Featurette class.
* Featurettes are now expected to extend the Featurette class.
* Featurettes now support the `data` function for accessing data attributes.

2.1.0 2014-03-31

* Featurette.get is now implemented in a way that allows garbage collection
  on removed DOM elements. Featurettes are now attached directly to the DOM
  rather than being stored in a collection in the `Featurette` class.
* Fixed an issue where calling `Featurette.load` within a featurette constructor
  would cause infinite recursion.
* Super special thanks to [Rick Harris](https://github.com/rickharris) for his
  help on this release.
